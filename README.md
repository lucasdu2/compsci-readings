# compsci-readings
Place to keep track of non-coursework, non-book computer science literature that
I have read or want to read. This generally consists of webpages, documents, and 
academic papers I stumble upon. Basically just a miscellaneous set of computer
science related readings that interest me. 

This repo will be updated whenever there is something new to add and as long as 
it is useful.

A To Be Read list (ala Goodreads) to track of papers I want to read can be found
at [tbr.md](tbr.md).

A good paper reading technique is introduced in 
["How to Read a Paper" (Keshav)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs245/readings/how-to-read-a-paper.pdf).

Below are some places to look for papers. Mostly for me, if I'm bored, want to 
read a computer science paper, and have nothing already in mind.

- **Distributed Systems**
    - [DistSys Reading Group](http://charap.co/category/reading-group/)
    - Reading lists: [1](http://dancres.github.io/Pages/), [2](https://christophermeiklejohn.com/distributed/systems/2013/07/12/readings-in-distributed-systems.html)
    - Long-form notes: [Notes on Theory of Distributed Systems](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/465/notes.pdf)
- **Databases**
    - [db-readings](https://github.com/rxin/db-readings)
    - [Readings in Database Systems](http://www.redbook.io/)
- **General**
    - [ACM Queue](https://queue.acm.org/), particularly the Research for Practice tag
    - [USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conferences) conferences, particularly OSDI, 
FAST, and NSDI
    - [ACM](https://dl.acm.org/) publications (although these are not all publicly 
accessible), especially from [PODC](https://www.podc.org/)

Here are some people in the computer science world that I currently think
are interesting/inspiring. This is also mostly just for me.
