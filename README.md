# compsci-readings
Place to keep track of non-coursework, non-book computer science literature that
I have read or want to read. This generally consists of webpages, documents, and 
academic papers I stumble upon. Basically just a miscellaneous set of computer
science related readings that interest me. 

This repo will be updated whenever there is something new to add and as long as 
it is useful.

Below are some places to look for papers. Mostly for me, if I'm bored, want to 
read a computer science paper, and have nothing already in mind.

- [DistSys Reading Group](http://charap.co/category/reading-group/)
- [db-readings](https://github.com/rxin/db-readings)
- [Readings in Database Systems](http://www.redbook.io/)
- [ACM Queue](https://queue.acm.org/), particularly the Research for Practice tag
- [USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/conferences) conferences, particularly OSDI, 
FAST, and NSDI
- [ACM](https://dl.acm.org/) publications (although these are not all publicly 
accessible), especially from [PODC](https://www.podc.org/)
