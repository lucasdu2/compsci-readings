# compsci-readings
## Purpose
Place to keep track of non-coursework, non-book computer science literature that
I have read. This generally consists of webpages, documents, and academic papers 
I stumble upon and think are interesting.

This repo will be updated whenever there is something new to add and for as long 
as it is useful.

A paper reading technique is introduced in 
["How to Read a Paper" (Keshav)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs245/readings/how-to-read-a-paper.pdf).

## Places to find papers (in case of boredom)
Below are some places to look for papers in areas that I think are cool. 

- **Distributed Systems**
    - [DistSys Reading Group](http://charap.co/category/reading-group/)
    - Reading lists: [1](http://dancres.github.io/Pages/), [2](https://christophermeiklejohn.com/distributed/systems/2013/07/12/readings-in-distributed-systems.html)
    - Long-form notes: [Notes on Theory of Distributed Systems](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/465/notes.pdf)
- **Databases**
    - [db-readings](https://github.com/rxin/db-readings)
    - [Readings in Database Systems](http://www.redbook.io/)
    - [VLDB](http://vldb.org/pvldb)
- **General**
    - [ACM Queue](https://queue.acm.org/), particularly the Research for Practice tag
    - [ACM](https://dl.acm.org/) publications (although these are not all publicly 
accessible), especially from [PODC](https://www.podc.org/)

## People, projects I like
